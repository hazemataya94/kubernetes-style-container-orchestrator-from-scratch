### Goal
be comfortable writing Go programs

### Focus topics
- Packages, interfaces, context.Context, error handling patterns
- Concurrency: goroutines, channels, worker pools
- HTTP servers/clients, gRPC
- CLI basics (cobra optional), logging, testing

### Mini-projects
- Build a small REST API server with CRUD + watch-like long polling
- Build a gRPC server that exposes CRUD for resources (Apply/Get/List/Delete)
- Build a controller loop: “desired state” file → reconcile into “actual state” folder
- Build a tiny kubectl-like CLI that talks to your API server
- Controller + Work Queue: gRPC server stores desired state, controller subscribes via stream, reconciles, and reports status back via gRPC
- Leader election: Build a small leader-election mechanism (in-memory first, then etcd). Run 3 replicas of a controller; only leader reconciles
